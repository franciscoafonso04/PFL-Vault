## **Description of the Game**

**Collapse** is a strategic two-player board game where the primary objective is to outmaneuver your opponent by capturing their pieces or forcing them into a position where they cannot make a valid move. The game is played on a **9x5 grid board**, traditionally associated with the Fanorona board design, and involves capturing opponent pieces through collisions.

### **Game Rules**

1. **Setup**:
   - The game starts with pieces placed around the perimeter of a 9x5 board.
   - Players decide if they want to play first (**white**) or second (**black**).
   - In **Player vs Bot** mode, the player always plays first (white), while in **Bot vs Player** mode, the player takes the second turn (black).

2. **Movement**:
   - A piece can move in one of eight directions: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.
   - Movement rules depend on the active **rule**:
     - **Normal Rule**: Diagonal moves are only allowed on cells where the sum of row and column coordinates is even (as per Fanorona board design).
     - **Easy Rule**: Diagonal moves are allowed on all cells.

3. **Capturing**:
   - A move is valid only if it results in the capture of exactly one opponent piece.
   - The piece moves in a straight line along the grid until it collides with an opponent's piece.
   - Capturing rules:
     - The move must result in the capture of one opponent piece.
     - The piece cannot change direction during the move.
     - The piece cannot move in a direction where there is no opponent piece to collide with.
   - Captured pieces are removed from the board immediately.

4. **Gameplay**:
   - Players alternate turns, making one valid move per turn.
   - A player must choose a move that results in the capture of an opponent's piece.

5. **Game End**:
   - The game ends when a player is unable to make a valid move on their turn.
   - This includes scenarios where all of a player's pieces have been captured.
   - The remaining player is declared the winner.

### **Game Objective**

The main objective is to strategically position your pieces while capturing your opponent's. Players must also anticipate their opponent's moves to avoid being left without a valid capture.

## **Considerations for Game Extensions**  

During the development of **Collapse**, we explored various ways to provide flexibility and adaptability in gameplay. This led to the implementation of **optional rules**, allowing players to choose the complexity of the game while maintaining its essence.  

### **1. Normal Rule**  
In the standard mode, diagonal moves are restricted to cells where the sum of the coordinates `(X + Y)` is an even number. This restriction reflects the design of the Fanorona board, where diagonal connections are valid only in specific positions. This rule challenges players to plan their moves strategically while working within these constraints, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay.  

### **2. Easy Rule**  
Initially, the game was developed using what is now called the "easy rule," allowing diagonal moves on any cell regardless of the coordinate parity. However, during the evaluation of potential extensions, we discovered that this rule was inconsistent with the Fanorona board's standard design. Despite this realization, the easy rule was retained as a beginner-friendly option, providing a simpler and more accessible gameplay experience for novice players.  

### **Variable Board Sizes**  
The possibility of introducing variable board sizes was considered but deemed unnecessary. The fixed 9x5 board size ensures a pre-defined arrangement of pieces, central to the game's strategy. Expanding the board size would require significant adjustments to the initial setup and could distort the gameplay, moving away from the original intent of the game.  

By addressing these considerations, we aimed to make **Collapse** both engaging for experienced players and approachable for those new to the game.

## **Game Logic**

The implementation of **Collapse** in Prolog reflects careful design decisions to ensure a robust and user-friendly gaming experience. The following subsections describe the representation and handling of game configuration, game state, move representation, and user interaction.

### **Game Configuration Representation**
The game configuration represents the setup information necessary to initialize the game. It includes the following details:
- **Player Types**: Indicates whether each player is a human or a computer/bot (e.g., `human`, `computer(Level)`).
- **Game Rule**: Specifies whether the game uses the **Normal Rule** (restricted diagonals) or **Easy Rule** (diagonals allowed anywhere).

Internally, this configuration is stored as a list:
```prolog
[Player1Type, Player2Type, Rule]
```
For example:
- `human vs human` with the Normal Rule: `[human, human, 1]`
- `human vs computer` with Easy Rule: `[human, computer(2), 2]`

The `initial_state/2` predicate uses this configuration to initialize the game state, including setting up the board, assigning the first player (`player1`), and applying the selected rule.

---

### **Internal Game State Representation**
The game state represents all necessary information to track the current status of the game. It is stored in the structure:
```prolog
game_state(Board, CurrentPlayer, Rule)
```
- **Board**: A 2D list representing the 9x5 grid. Each cell is an atom (`black`, `white`, or `empty`) indicating the piece or its absence.
  - Example of the initial board:
    ```prolog
    [
        [black, white, black, white, black, white, black, white, black],
        [white, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, white],
        [empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty],
        [black, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, black],
        [white, black, white, black, white, black, white, black, white]
    ]
    ```
- **CurrentPlayer**: Indicates the current player (`player1` or `player2`).
- **Rule**: Specifies the active rule (e.g., `1` for Normal Rule or `2` for Easy Rule).

**Examples**:
- **Initial State**:
   ```prolog
   game_state(Board, player1, 1)
   ```

  ![Initial Board](files/initial_board.png)

---

- **Intermediate State**:
   After a few moves, the board and current player might look like:

   ```prolog
   game_state(Board, player2, 1)
   ```

  ![Initial Board](files/intermediate_board.png)

---

- **Final State**:
   When a player cannot make a valid move, game over and the other player is declared as the winner.

   ```prolog
   game_over(game_state(Board, player2, 1), player1)
   ```

   ![Initial Board](files/final_board.png)

---

### **Move Representation**
Moves in **Collapse** are represented as:
```prolog
move(Row, Col, Dir)
```
- **Row**: The row number of the piece being moved (1-5).
- **Col**: The column number of the piece being moved (1-9).
- **Dir**: The direction of movement (`north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`).

The `move/3` predicate uses this representation to:
1. Validate the move using `valid_moves/2`.
2. Update the board by removing the piece from its original position, capturing the opponent's piece, and placing the player's piece in its final position.
3. Switch to the next player.

For example:
- A move from the piece in row 3, column 5, in the north direction:
  ```prolog
  move(3, 5, north)
  ```

---

### **User Interaction**
The game features a structured menu system and user-friendly interaction methods to guide players through their choices and gameplay.

#### **Menu System**:
The menu is implemented using `display_main_menu/3`, which allows players to:
1. Choose the game mode (e.g., `Player vs Player`, `Player vs Bot`).
2. Select the rule set (`Normal` or `Easy`).
3. Set the computer/bot difficulty level when applicable (`Level 1` or `Level 2`).

#### **Input Validation**:
Player input is validated to ensure it respects the game's rules and format:
- **Move Input**: Players are prompted to input a move in the format:
  ```prolog
  move(row, col, dir).
  ```
  - Validation ensures the move exists in the list of valid moves (`valid_moves/2`).
  - Invalid inputs prompt the player to try again.

- **Menu Input**: Menu options are validated using Prolog's `member/2` predicate. Invalid options are rejected with a prompt to re-enter a valid choice.

#### **Error Handling**:
The program uses a combination of recursive calls and `repeat` loops to manage invalid input gracefully:
- Incorrect menu selections lead to a re-prompt for valid input.
- Invalid moves in the game prompt the player to try again without disrupting gameplay.
