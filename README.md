# PFL-Vault  

Welcome to the **PFL-Vault**, a repository containing our projects for the **Functional and Logic Programming (Programação Funcional e em Lógica)** course. Here, you'll find implementations exploring declarative programming paradigms, leveraging **formal reasoning** to solve complex problems effectively.  

## Projects  

### **Project 1: RoadMap**  
- **Description**: Developed a graph-based model representing a country's road network, consisting of interconnected cities. The project focused on defining and using appropriate data structures to represent and manipulate the graph efficiently.  

### **Project 2: Collapse**  
- **Description**: Implemented the **Collapse board game** using **Prolog**, focusing on **game logic, AI opponents, and strategic gameplay mechanics**. Key features include:  
  - **Game logic implementation** based on Fanorona board rules.  
  - **Two-player mode** and AI-controlled opponent with different difficulty levels.  
  - **Structured board representation** and **state management** in Prolog.  
  - **User-friendly interaction** with a menu system and robust input validation.
