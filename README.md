# PFL-Vault

Welcome to the **PFL-Vault**, a repository containing our projects for the **Functional and Logic Programming (Programação Funcional e em Lógica)** course. Here, you'll find implementations and experiments focusing on declarative approaches to programming, based on formal reasoning processes, which are more appropriate for resolving some types of problems.
